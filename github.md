## 1\. Repositories

A **repository (repo)** is where your project lives. It contains your source code, documentation, images, and version history. Repositories can be public or private and support collaboration.

## 2\. Version Control with Git

GitHub uses **Git**, a distributed version control system. Git tracks changes to files, allows multiple contributors to work simultaneously, and maintains a complete history of modifications.

## 3\. Branching

Branches allow developers to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. Once completed, branches can be merged back into the main branch.

## 4\. Pull Requests

Pull Requests (PRs) enable contributors to propose changes, review code, discuss improvements, and merge updates into the main branch after approval.

## 5\. Issues

Issues help track bugs, feature requests, tasks, and improvements. They can be assigned to team members, labeled, and linked to pull requests.

## 6\. GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions enables automation directly within repositories. You can build, test, and deploy code automatically using CI/CD workflows.

## 7\. GitHub Projects

GitHub Projects provides project management tools such as Kanban boards, task tracking, and workflow automation to organize and prioritize work.

## 8\. GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages allows users to host static websites directly from a repository. It is commonly used for documentation sites, portfolios, and project demos.

## 9\. GitHub Discussions

GitHub Discussions provides a space for community conversations, Q&A, announcements, and idea sharing outside of issues and pull requests.

## 10\. GitHub Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces offers cloud-based development environments that allow developers to code directly in the browser without needing local setup.
